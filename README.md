All the apps which are connected to music are getting popular in our day-to-day life  in the same way we are creating a music recommendation system to help the user to listen to the songs almost near this interest 
we make our machine create a function using  pandas and NumPy libraries in the Python platform 
And we make our function to evaluate and with other songs and filter out the songs which are near to the interest of the user 
Python is used, which is high in the library and also makes our work easier 
It is known that there are many algorithms but we use the content-based algorithm 
Since using the content-based algorithm we also have to use the vector-spaced method which is a part of the algorithm 
We make the project as simple like:
 1. Data gathering
 2. Making the code for training the machine to get similar songs for the user 
 3. Connect our model of code to Spotify API 
 4. Creating a playlist and getting recommendations 
 
This is the way we have to approach completing our project
The main thing to keep in observation is that when using content-based filtering, the user must have at least one playlist of a bundle of songs if not this is a disadvantage for the sake of the new user.
